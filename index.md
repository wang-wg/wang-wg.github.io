## Wenguang Wang’s Homepage
I’m Wenguang Wang, a Master in the Institute of Computer Science & Technology of Peking University ([ICST](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/)), also a member of Character Shape Computing Lab ([CSCL](http://59.108.48.27/cscl/)).

### Education

+ Master:   2017.09-2020.07   Peking University   Computer Science 
+ Bachelor: 2013.09-2017.07   Sichuan University  Electronic Engineering

### Skills

+ Skilled at c++, python, matlab, tensorflow.
+ Familiar with machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

### Project Experience

#### Chinese Stroke Extraction by Semantic Segmentation and Tabu Search
+ Task: stroke extraction of Chinese character.
+ Two improvements in original semantic segmentation models (Such as DeepLab v1, v3+):
  + Stroke list module: guide the model by priori information like stroke count.
  + Inference module: replace the background channel by binary images of the characters.
+ Use tabu search algorithm for stroke ordering problem. We regard it as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and add stroke categories penalty term into the fitness function to improve the accuracy.
+ Build a dataset containing 10 different fonts for stroke extraction (Pascal voc 2012 style).
+ 300 times faster and 4.65% more accurate than the state-of-the-art.

### Awards
1. National Scholarship (twice, 2014--2015&2015--2016)
2. Tanglixin Scholarship (60 people per year, 2016--2020)
3. Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest, the Second Prize (international)
